# What is the Eagle Plugin System?

The Eagle Plugin System allows developers to create custom plugins to extend the functionality of Eagle. For example, you can develop a feature for Eagle that it doesn't currently have or support a file format that it doesn't yet preview. Developing plugins is very simple, as Eagle plugins are written in JavaScript and HTML, which are easy to learn and get started with.

The Eagle Plugin System supports the following development technologies:

Web-based Technology:

Eagle plugins are developed using web-based technologies and are written in the JavaScript language. Developers can create their own plugins using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to extend the functionality of the browser using APIs.

Supports NodeJS native APIs and third-party modules:

Eagle plugins support Node.js native APIs and third-party modules. These features can help developers avoid reinventing the wheel while increasing development speed.

Eagle Plugin API is similar to the Eagle Restful API. The Eagle Plugin API can get and modify the current saved file and folder data in the Eagle application. Developers can easily access files and folders in the Eagle application and perform more operations on them.


By using the Eagle Plugin System, you can develop a variety of interesting tools to add new functionality and practicality to the Eagle application. Here are some examples:

Batch processing:

Tools for batch renaming, batch compression, batch conversion of file formats, etc. to help you quickly process large numbers of files.

Image processing:

Tools for cropping, compressing, and performing OCR on images to help you quickly process images.

Download tools:

Image and video download tools to quickly download images and videos from the web.

Format extension:

Various file types that Eagle does not support yet, such as ePub and Markdown.

Data export:

Tools for exporting data as CSV or Excel, making it easy for users to use this data.

These are just a few examples, and you can develop many more interesting tools to add more functionality and practicality to the Eagle application.
